## Summary (Summarize the bug encountered concisely)
A typo is present in the GitLab project creation page. Instead of the correct phrase "Create blank project," it mistakenly reads "Create black project.



## Steps to reproduce
Go to the GitLab project creation page: GitLab New Project. Look for the heading or button that says "Create blank project." Observe that the text is incorrectly displayed as "Create black project."     

   

## What is the current bug behavior?
The text "Create blank project" is displayed as "Create black project," which is a typographical error.

     

## What is the expected correct behavior?
The text should be displayed as "Create blank project" to correctly describe the action of creating a new empty project.
